Problem :---------------KNN classifier for hand written digit classification -------------------


DataSet : MNIST dataset

Requirements : Octave 4.0.2 

We can also easily convert the program to MATLAB compatible , by using  bsxfun() function 
because a = [1 2;3 4]-[1 1] , so a should be a = [0 1;2 3] , this works fine in octave, we can also make it work in MATLAB using  bsxfun() function
